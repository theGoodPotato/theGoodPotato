## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm theGoodPotato, and I like to code in my free time. 
I'm currently working on & learning Python. 
If my commit text is different from conventional standards, it is because I am also learning how people use Git. 

The code on my GitHub is to showcase my work and let them be used by others for examples or inspiration. 
This is why I make it avaliable using a free software licence. 
If my contribution graph doesn't show any activity, it is because I work better when I switch between projects. I have not left GitHub! 

All my new commits should be verified under vigilant mode. 

To contact me, make an issue in this repository.
